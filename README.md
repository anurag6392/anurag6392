Hi there, I'm Anurag! 👋
What's up, friends! 👋 I'm a computer science student

I LOVE writing code! ❤️ It makes me so happy! 😄 Whether I'm goofing in notebooks 📓 or coding in Python 🐍, writing programs is a blast! 💥 When I'm not geeking out over AI 🤖 with my classmates or building neural networks, 🧠 you can find me buried in statistics textbooks. 📚 I know, what a nerd! 🤓

I'm always down to learn new ways to speak human 🫂 and computer 💻. Making tech more fun is my jam! 🍇

If you want a cheery data buddy 😎 who can make difficult things easy-peasy 🥝 and learning a party 🎉, I'm your guy! 🙋‍♂️
